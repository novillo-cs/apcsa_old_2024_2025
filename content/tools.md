# Piazza
This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, and myself. I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza.

Find our class signup link [here]()

Piazza access code provided in class. If you missed it, ask the teacher.

# Google Classroom
It will be used for exit tickets only. All other assignments will be submitted on GitHub.

# Git
It is an open-source version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development.

## GitHub
It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 

## Repositories (Repos)
- A repository is a project folder where code, documentation, and other resources are stored.
- Repos can be public (visible to everyone) or private (visible only to specific people or organizations).
- Each repository contains all project files and the history of changes made to those files.

## Markdown & Documentation

GitHub supports Markdown for writing formatted documentation, which is commonly used in README files to explain projects. [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Installing Git
**Mac and Linux:** Git should be installed already.

**Windows:** Install git and the shell gitbash from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/). This includes git, gitbash, and has shell integration so that you can right-click on a folder in Windows Explorer to access gitbash at that location.

## Git commands

**The git config command:** Configuring user information used across all local repositories. The following commands set a name and an email address that are associated with each version history.

```
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME_HERE"
git config --global user.email YOUR_EMAIL_HERE
```

The basic commands we are going to use in this class are:

- **git clone:** Retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL.
- **git pull:** Fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.
- **git add:** Add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage).
- **git commit:** Commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.
- **git push:** Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.
- **git diff:** Displays diff of what is changed but not staged.
