1. Draw the call stack for fibIter(10, 1, 0) in your notebook, take a picture and upload it to your repo.

2. Let's implement the iterative Fibonacci algorithm. Create a Fibonacci.java file and implement the following method:

/*
 * Preconditions:
 * n is a non-negative integer
 * n refers to the nth element in the fib sequequence
 * initial f1 value is 1
 * initial f2 value is 0
 */

 public static int fibIter(int n, int f1, int f2){
   // remember the recursive case calls  fibIter once
 }
