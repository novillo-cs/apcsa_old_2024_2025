Write a program that:

  - Asks the user for two integers x and y
  - Divides the two ints
  - Prints the result
    
The trick here is that we want the division of the two ints to result in a double! Casting values to doubles will be necessary to solve this exercise.
Here is an example:

```
x = 3

y = 4

Output => 0.75
```
