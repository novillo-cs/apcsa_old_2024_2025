**Part 1**

Answer these questions:

1. Can you call a static method from a non-static one?
2. Or vice versa, can you call a non-static method from a static one?
3. Try that in your class Employee, and write your answers as comments at the end of your Employee class.

**Part 2**

We want to implement (write) a class Point, which fields represent a 2D coordinate (x, y). Let's think about the class design.

1. How many instance variable are needed? Private or Public?
2. What constructors should be needed?
3. What methods do you think should be needed?
4. Would it be possible to make the Point class immutable? If so, how?

Write your answers to those questions in a txt, md or any text file. 

Save here: `.../APCSA_1/apcsa-assignments-YourUsername/classwork/11_coordinate/answers.txt`

**Part 3**

Go [here](https://github.com/novillo-cs/apcsa_material/tree/main/classwork/11_coordinates) and copy the Point.java and Driver.java in your folder classwork folder "11_coordinate".

Look at the Driver file:

There are a few questions to respond in that file. Please write your answers as comments in Driver.java

Optional: If you have time you may start writting the Point class. Otherwise, no worries we will work on this on Monday.

DO NOT FORGET TO COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR CHANGES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.

I will look at this classwork. I will not accept late submissions for this one, exception a justified absence.
