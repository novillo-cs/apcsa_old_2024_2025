- Create the following classes: Shape (superclass), Rectangle, Triangle.
- Rectangle and Triangle should inherit from Shape.
- Declare private instance variables in class Shape: double height and double width.
- Write a constructor in class Shape to initialize the values for height and width.
- Write public methods in class Shape to get/set height and width values: getHeight(), getWidth(), setHeight() and setWidth().
- Write a method getArea() in both of the subclasses Rectangle and Triangle which calculates and returns the area the result.
- You will need to define the constructors in Rectangle and Triangle classes (which call the Shape constructor).
