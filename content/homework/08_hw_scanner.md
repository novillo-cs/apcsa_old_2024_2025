Follow these directions to write your NightOut.java program:

You and a friend are going out for the night. You have decided to treat your friend, so you’re paying for the whole night. However, since you have a fixed amount of money to spend on fun things, you need to track how much the outing will cost so you can update your budget.

Write a program to help yourself estimate what the total cost of the night will be. Your program will estimate the cost by taking the cost of the activities for one person and estimating how much it will cost for two people.

Here’s what you know about your activities: Dinner - you know you typically get cheap dinners, so you expect that your friend’s dinner will be twice as expensive as yoursLaser Tag - since laser tag is charged per person, you and your friend will cost the sameIce cream - you like the triple scoop, but your friend likes a single scoop. Your friend’s ice cream will cost 1/3 as much as yours.

Your program should ask how much YOUR dinner cost, how much laser tag costs per person, and how much YOUR ice cream costs. It should then compute how much your friend’s costs will be based on the information above. Be sure your program takes the input in this exact order.
Then print how much dinner will cost (for both of you), how much laser tag will cost (for both of you), and how much the ice cream will cost (for both of you). Then print the grand total for the evening.

Your output should look something like this:

```
How much does dinner usually cost? 

12.63

How much is laser tag for one person? 

17.50

How much does a triple scoop cost? 

27.00

Dinner: $37.89

Laser Tag: $35.0  

Ice cream: $36.0

Grand Total: $108.89
```
