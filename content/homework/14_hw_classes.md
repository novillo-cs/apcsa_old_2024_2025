This homework is exactly the same as your classwork, but now we want to design an Employee class.

A big part of using classes in Java is thinking about the design of the class. Youâ€™ll need to figure out what information needs to be in the class For instance, in our Rectangle class, we needed to know the width and height. This exercise is a free response question. Imagine that someone comes to you and asks you to design a class that represents a Employee.

1. What instance variables should the Employee class have?

2. What do the instance variables represent? What are the types of those instance variables?

3. What methods would you implement in your Employee class?
